## Fullstack Challenge

### Problem statement

You just arrived in your new role. As a fullstack developer, you've been assigned to solve a complex problem with users credentials accross multiple systems. As we are a big company, many of our systems have different mehtods of login with different technologies. 

You've been requested to pilot a possible solution using Event Driven Architecture. So your pilot must deliver:

1. 1 Page that register a new user in a queue;
2. a backend that listen this queue and register this new user in a database
3. 1 Page that show all the users registered 
4. 1 Page that validate users login.
5. 1 Application Diagram explaning the solution

As this challenge its a pilot, fell free to use Cloud solutions and any web languages and databases that suites you best.

Good Look! =D
